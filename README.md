The machine-learning-based project aims to develop a web-based Braille and Sign Language
application. This project also detects sign language in text using a skeleton. After detection, it
also converts text to speech. It also converts text to sign language. On the other hand, the Braille
Language to Text here shows the graphical view of any alphabet and vice versa. There are some
additional features if someone doesnâ€™t know sign language or Braille language. There are learning
pages for both sign language and sign language with a voice system.
